# Welcome to CollaboNote
This will be a full-stack project built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), and focus heavily on community and data.
The concept is a mix of early day tumblr and pinterests light social media feel where users could post, collaborate and
share their goals. 

## Tech Stack (Front-End):
- NextJS 14 with TypeScript
- SCSS Modules
- React Query
- Redux & Redux Toolkit
- React Hook Form

## Tech Stack (Back-End):
- PostgresSQL
- ExpressJS / NodeJS that's built in with NextJS14
- Web Sockets


## Getting Started (Development)
This is a long term project that I primarily wlll heavily use and practice more Redux & Redux Toolkit as well as experiment
with technologies I do not normally use. For example, I typically use MongoDB but for this project is will have a PostgresSQL 
database.

## Development Plans and Thoughts
I plan to develop this throughout the course of 2025. I am not planning on any monetization and this is purely just to keep my
development skills sharp while trying new patterns. As such, I will keep this repository public as both a reference to myself,
and others including curious friends, strangers wanting to learn and future employers.

I also want my creative juices to flow and will mess around with graphics as well. Since this is a public repostiory that will 
use postgresSQL maybe I'll have it so other people can run their own postgresSQL db too and not have a central hosted maybe. If
this site ever does get users or ran locally to add own would be good learning experience. This is more of a comfort project and
on exploration than any big serious one, but definitely a big one.

### Running locally
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
