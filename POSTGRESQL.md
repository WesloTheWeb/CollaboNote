# PostgreSQL Implementation Notes

This document provides an overview of the direct PostgreSQL implementation used in this project.
**REFERENCE DOCUMENT**

## Core Components

1. **Database Connection Module** (`src/lib/db.ts`)
   - Creates and manages a PostgreSQL connection pool
   - Provides query execution interface
   - Handles error logging and connection management
   - Includes utility functions for table management

2. **API Routes** (`src/app/api/[endpoint]/route.ts`)
   - Use the db module to interact with the database
   - Implementation of REST endpoints using NextJS App Router
   - Input validation with Zod
   - Error handling and security measures

## Key Concepts in Direct PostgreSQL Usage

### Connection Pooling

The implementation uses connection pooling to efficiently manage database connections:

```typescript
const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString,
  max: 20, // Maximum number of clients in the pool
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000, // Close idle clients after 30 seconds
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000, // Return error if connection takes too long
});
```

Connection pooling helps improve performance by:
- Reusing database connections instead of creating new ones for each request
- Managing connection limits to prevent overwhelming the database
- Handling connection timeouts and errors gracefully

### Parameterized Queries

All database queries use parameterization to prevent SQL injection:

```typescript
const result = await db.query(
  'SELECT * FROM "User" WHERE email = $1',
  [email]
);
```

The `$1, $2, etc.` placeholders ensure that user input is properly escaped and cannot be used for SQL injection attacks.

### Transaction Support

For operations that require multiple queries to be executed as a single unit, you can use transactions:

```typescript
const client = await db.getClient();
try {
  await client.query('BEGIN');
  // Execute multiple queries...
  await client.query('COMMIT');
} catch (error) {
  await client.query('ROLLBACK');
  throw error;
} finally {
  client.release();
}
```

### Schema Management

The implementation includes functions to manage database schema:

```typescript
await db.ensureTable('TableName', 'CREATE TABLE ...');
```

This allows for programmatic creation and management of database tables without requiring a separate migration system.

## PostgreSQL vs ORMs

### Advantages of Direct PostgreSQL

1. **Full SQL Power**: Access to all PostgreSQL features and optimizations
2. **Performance**: Potentially better performance by avoiding ORM overhead
3. **Control**: Complete control over queries and database operations
4. **Transparency**: Clear visibility into what SQL is being executed

### When to Consider an ORM

1. **Schema Management**: ORMs like Prisma provide better tools for schema migrations
2. **Type Safety**: ORMs can provide stronger TypeScript integration
3. **Development Speed**: ORMs can reduce boilerplate code for common operations
4. **Query Building**: ORMs provide structured query building that can be easier to use

## Security Considerations

The implementation includes several security best practices:

1. **Parameterized Queries**: Prevents SQL injection
2. **Connection Limits**: Prevents resource exhaustion attacks
3. **Input Validation**: Validates all input before database operations
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling to prevent information leakage
5. **Password Hashing**: Secure password storage using bcrypt
