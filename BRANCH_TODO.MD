Since I am transferring this between my PC (Desktop) and Macbook at times. This will track progress.


# Branch Feature
This is the branch that will fleshout mainly the Dashboard. I do not have a design yet and there are a lot of moving parts.

What I hope this branch accomplishes:

1. Fleshed out Dashboard
2. User setting page to change the first, last and user names.
    - Build this out with formBuilder 
3. Look into services for Password recovery
    - I am aware of some but unsure how generous free tier of email SMTP and security feature is.


## Dev Stuff
1. Get a modal system going
2. Dynamic nav menu with dashboard on mobile
